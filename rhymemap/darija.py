"""Moroccan Darija: Arabizi spelling -> phonemes -> syllables.

Darija is written online in *Arabizi*: Latin letters plus digits chosen for
their shape, because the Arabic letters they stand for have no Latin
equivalent.

    3 = ع   7 = ح   9 = ق   2 = ء   5 = خ (also written kh)

That convention is what makes this module possible. Arabizi is very nearly
phonemic -- a letter maps to a sound, not to three centuries of spelling drift
-- so Darija needs no pronunciation dictionary and no neural model. A grapheme
table and a syllabifier are enough, and unlike CMUdict they never miss a word.

Two things genuinely differ from English and are handled here:

**Places of articulation English does not have.** English stops at the velum;
Arabic keeps going, to the uvula (ق خ غ) and the pharynx (ح ع). Run "3ndi"
through an English grapheme-to-phoneme model and you get nonsense, because
there is no symbol for the sound the "3" is standing for. ``rhymemap.phonology``
carries those phonemes; this module is what produces them.

**Words with no written vowel.** "ktbt" (I wrote), "chft" (I saw), "drt" (I
did). Darija allows consonant clusters English never would, and the schwa that
breaks them up is not written down. Left alone these words have no nucleus at
all, so they would vanish from a rhyme analysis -- yet "drt"/"chft" is a real
rhyme, and a common one. ``_insert_schwas`` puts the vowel back.

Vowels deliberately reuse the English inventory (/a/ -> AA, /i/ -> IY, /u/ ->
UW, schwa -> AH0) instead of getting symbols of their own. Moroccan rap
code-switches constantly between Darija, French and English, often inside one
bar; a single shared vowel space is what lets the engine notice that "bzaf"
and "staff" rhyme. The consonants are extended because they had to be -- the
sounds are genuinely absent -- and the vowels are not, because they are not.
