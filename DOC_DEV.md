## 1. Overview <a name="overview"></a>

RhymeMapper converts lyrics into phonemes, splits them into syllables, extracts
each syllable's onset / nucleus / coda, groups syllables that rhyme, and reports
the result as coloured text, metrics, and figures.

## 3. Data models (`src/models.py`) <a name="models"></a>

### `Syllable`
- `text` – orthographic slice used for display. **Approximate**: the spelling is
  divided into equal spans rather than aligned to phonemes, so a boundary can sit
  a character or two off. Display only; it never affects matching.
- `nucleus` – vowel phoneme with stress, e.g. `"AA1"`.
- `coda` – consonants after the nucleus.
- `onset` – consonants before the nucleus. Kept because the similarity engine
  needs it: identical onset *and* identical rime is repetition, not rhyme.
- `is_terminal` – last syllable of the last word of a line.
- `rhyme_label` – assigned group, e.g. `"A"`, `"AB"`.
- `line_id`, `word_id`, `syl_index` – position, used to rebuild the syllable stream.

### `Nucleus`
A vowel with its stress and position. Predates `Syllable` and is retained as
public API; it is now **derived from the syllable split** rather than computed by
a second, independent phoneme pass.

### `Word`, `Line`, `Verse`
Containers. `Verse.syllables()` flattens the whole verse into one ordered list.

---

## 4. Phonetics (`src/phonetics.py`) <a name="phonetics"></a>

- `clean_word(text)` – strip punctuation, lowercase, trim.
- `lookup_variants(word)` – spellings to try against CMUdict before giving up:
  the word itself, then g-dropping (`comin` → `coming`), then clitic restoration
  (`dont` → `don't`, `hes` → `he's`). On the bundled corpus this resolves 21 of
  38 out-of-vocabulary words, and does so *more accurately* than the neural
  model, which returned `D AA1 N T` for `dont` and `TH AE1 T S` for `thats`.
- `phonemes_for_word(word)` – ARPAbet phonemes, reassembled from the syllable
  split for dictionary words and from `g2p_en` for the rest.
- `extract_syllables(...)` – the main entry point; returns `Syllable` objects with
  onset, nucleus, coda, position and `is_terminal` filled in.
- `heuristic_syllables(...)` – fallback for words CMUdict does not contain: start
  a new syllable at each vowel, attach following consonants as the coda.
- `process_line` / `process_verse` – assemble `Line` and `Verse` objects.

Both backends are constructed lazily. `G2p()` costs ~3.8s to build, and is only
needed for genuinely unknown words; building it at import time made every
command pay it, including `make test`.

---

## 5. Rhyme engine (`src/engine.py`) <a name="engine"></a>

### `label_for_index(i)`
Maps `0,1,2,…` to `A,B,…,Z,AA,AB,…`. The previous implementation indexed a
26-letter alphabet modulo its length, so the 27th group silently reused the first
group's label. A single dense verse exceeds 26 groups easily — *Rap God* produces
56 — so this corrupted real output rather than an edge case.

### `encode_coda(coda, use_consonant_families=False)`
Renders a coda as a signature fragment. With `use_consonant_families` each
consonant is replaced by its natural class from `CONSONANT_FAMILIES`
(NAS, PLO, SIB, FRI, LIQ, GLI, ASP), which is what lets `loud` and `out` — both
`AW` + plosive — group together.

> Earlier versions of this document stated that signatures used consonant
> families by default. They did not: `CONSONANT_FAMILIES` was defined and never
> referenced, and the signature used the raw coda. Family encoding is now
> implemented and available, but **off by default** so the exact-match behaviour
> stays reproducible as an evaluation baseline.

### `get_syllable_signature(syllable, use_consonant_families=False, include_stress=True)`
Returns `"{vowel}_{stress}_{coda}"`, or `""` for syllables that should be
ignored — currently unstressed syllables that are not line-final.

### `candidate_syllables(line, tail_window=None, only_terminal=False)`
Which syllables of a line may carry a label. `only_terminal` keeps just the
line-final syllable (classic end rhyme); `tail_window` keeps the last N.
`only_terminal` was previously accepted as a parameter and ignored.

### `assign_rhyme_labels(verse, ...)`
Two passes — count every signature, then label those reaching
`min_occurrences`. Returns the `RhymeRegistry` it used.

> `line.rhyme_label` exists on the model but is **not** written by this function,
> contrary to earlier documentation. Labels live on syllables.

---

## 5b. Similarity engine (`src/phonology.py`, `src/similarity.py`) <a name="similarity"></a>

The exact engine asks *"are these two signature strings equal?"*. Rhyme is not an
equality relation: "bit"/"beat" nearly rhyme, "bit"/"bought" do not, and exact
matching cannot express the difference. The similarity engine replaces the
string comparison with a score in [0, 1].

### `src/phonology.py` — the feature space

- **Vowels** are placed by height, backness, rounding, tenseness, the target of
  any offglide, and r-colouring. `vowel_distance` is their weighted distance.
- **Consonants** are described by place, manner and voicing; `manner_distance`
  encodes which manners sound alike (plosive/affricate are close, plosive/
  approximant are not).
- **Codas** are compared by `cluster_distance`: a Levenshtein alignment whose
  substitution cost is the feature distance between two consonants rather than
  0/1 on equality. This is what makes `-nt`/`-nd` near (0.10) and `-nt`/`-ks`
  far (0.48).

Both distances are rescaled by the largest distance attainable in their table.
Without that step the weighted averages never approached 1.0, the usable range
was compressed into roughly [0, 0.64], and unrelated pairs such as "cat"/"dog"
outscored genuine near-rhymes.

### `src/similarity.py` — scoring and grouping

```
score = (w_nucleus·nucleus_sim + w_coda·coda_sim + w_stress·stress_sim) / Σw
score ×= (1 − onset_identity_penalty)   if both onsets are non-empty and equal
```

The onset term is the part naive implementations miss: "cat"/"cat" and
`lookin'`/`lookin'` have a perfect rime, so a rime-only score rates them 1.0.
They are repetition, not rhyme. Two *empty* onsets are not penalised — sharing
"no onset" is not sharing an onset.

Observed ordering on the reference pairs:

| Pair | Score |
|---|---|
| cat / hat (perfect) | 1.00 |
| loud / out (slant) | 0.94 |
| bit / feet (near) | 0.87 |
| **cat / cat (repetition)** | **0.65** |
| cat / dog (unrelated) | 0.55 |
| cat / cool (unrelated) | 0.20 |

All weights live in `DEFAULT_WEIGHTS`, a single documented dict, so the
configuration is one object to defend and one object for `eval/` to sweep.

Grouping is agglomerative clustering with **average** linkage over the pairwise
distance matrix. Average linkage matters: with single linkage one loose pair
chains two unrelated rhyme families into a single group. The matrix is built
over *distinct* rhyme keys rather than syllable instances, since a dense verse
repeats sounds heavily.

### `src/labeling.py` — engine selection

Every CLI takes `--engine {exact, families, similarity}` and dispatches through
`label_verse`. `exact` is the v1 baseline, preserved so the evaluation in
`eval/` has something honest to compare against.

On the bundled corpus:

| Engine | Mean density | Mean multi | Mean groups |
|---|---|---|---|
| exact | 29.3% | 1.1% | 6.8 |
| families | 38.5% | 1.7% | 8.5 |
| similarity | 61.6% | 6.6% | 9.2 |

These numbers show the engines behave *differently*, not that one is *better* —
a higher density is equally consistent with over-grouping. Phase 4 settles that
against a hand-annotated gold set.

---

## 5c. Chain detection (`src/chains.py`) <a name="chains"></a>

Per-syllable labelling cannot represent the structure a listener actually hears.
In

    levitatin' / devastatin' / demonstratin'

every syllable gets assigned to whichever group its own sound falls in, and the
four-syllable repeat is never represented. `src/chains.py` looks for repeated
*spans* instead.

### Method

1. Flatten the verse into a syllable stream carrying `(line_id, word_id, syl_index)`.
2. Slide windows of 1..`max_window` syllables, never crossing a line break.
3. Cluster windows of equal length; the pairwise score is the mean of the
   per-syllable scores at each position.
4. Split each cluster by locality, then keep clusters recurring at least
   `min_occurrences` times.
5. Assign greedily, **longest first**, so a long chain claims its syllables
   before the fragments inside it can.

`strength = length × mean_similarity × occurrence_count` is reported for each
chain and orders chains *of equal length*.

### Three constraints that the first version lacked

**Selection order.** Ranking candidates by strength alone does not work: strength
is proportional to occurrence count, so a one-syllable "chain" recurring 153
times (strength 147) outranks a four-syllable chain recurring three times
(strength ~11). Ordering by strength let short chains claim the whole verse
before a long one was considered — the exact shredding this module exists to
prevent. Length is therefore the primary sort key.

**Per-position floor and end anchor.** A window's mean similarity can clear the
threshold on two strong positions while the rest disagree. Every position must
now reach `min_position_similarity`, and the final position must reach
`anchor_similarity`, because multisyllabic rhymes are anchored at their end.

**Locality.** Rhyme is local. Without a proximity constraint every syllable joins
some chain, because in a 1476-syllable verse drawn from ~400 distinct sounds any
span finds a partner *somewhere* — 80 lines away, where no listener hears it.
Raising the similarity threshold does not fix this; at 0.94 coverage was still
91%. `max_line_gap` (default 2, a couplet) is the constraint that was missing:

| Max line gap | Chain density | Multisyllabic coverage |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 78.3% | 41.0% |
| 2 (default) | 86.0% | 47.6% |
| 4 | 91.9% | 54.9% |
| none | 99.3% | 79.7% |

### Result on the demo verse

Detection takes ~2.5s for 1476 syllables. The strongest long chains it recovers:

| Length | Occurrences | Similarity | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | 4 | 0.94 | `straight face lookin' boy` / `take place lookin' boy` |
| 5 | 3 | 0.93 | `is ricochetin'` / `I'm devastatin'` / `it's levitatin'` |
| 5 | 2 | 0.96 | `a Rap God Rap God` / `the back nod back nod` |
| 5 | 2 | 0.96 | `honesty's brutal` / `honestly futile` |

### Metrics

`chain_metrics(verse, chains)` reports `chain_density`, `multi_score` (coverage
by chains of length ≥ 2), `chains`, `longest_chain` and `mean_chain_length`.

`metrics.compute_metrics` stays the engine-agnostic view and agrees on density.
Its `multi` runs about two points higher because it also counts two *adjacent*
occurrences of a one-syllable chain as a run, which `chain_metrics` does not.

---

## 5d. Audio sync (`src/timing.py`, `scripts/align_audio.py`) <a name="timing"></a>

`notes.md` has asked for this since March: attach a time to each word so the
rhymes light up along with the track.

Forced alignment is **not** a dependency. Every aligner is heavy — WhisperX pulls
in torch, aeneas needs espeak and ffmpeg — so `scripts/align_audio.py` uses
whichever happens to be installed and prints the options when neither is.
Nothing under `src/` imports them, and `make install` is unchanged.

`src/timing.py` reads what those tools emit:

| Format | Shape |
|---|---|
| JSON | `[{"word": "palms", "start": 0.51, "end": 0.78}, ...]`, or a `{"words": [...]}` wrapper (WhisperX) |
| WebVTT / SRT | one cue per word |
| Audacity labels | `start<TAB>end<TAB>word` |

`attach_timings` walks the verse and the timing list together with a small
lookahead. Timing files and lyrics disagree constantly — ad-libs, censored words,
`y'all` against `yall` — so an unmatched word is skipped rather than dragging
every later word out of step. Syllable times are interpolated across each word by
syllable count.

In the viewer, `setupAudio` only shows the player when the verse has both an
audio file and timings; otherwise the page behaves exactly as before.

### Two things that had to be fixed to make playback work

**Seeking needs HTTP Range support.** `SimpleHTTPRequestHandler` does not
implement it, and a browser will not seek within media served without it:
setting `audio.currentTime` silently snapped back to 0, so the track could be
played from the start but never scrubbed. `Handler.send_head` now serves
`206 Partial Content` and advertises `Accept-Ranges`.

**`timeupdate` does not fire on a paused element.** Scrubbing a paused track left
the highlight where it was, so the viewer also listens for `seeked` and
`loadedmetadata`.

The highlight lookup is a binary search over the syllables sorted by start time.
`timeupdate` fires about four times a second and a linear scan of ~1500
syllables each time is wasteful enough to show up on a phone.

---

## 5e. Naming rhyme groups (`src/naming.py`) <a name="naming"></a>

Groups were labelled `A`, `B`, … `Z`, `AA`, `AB`, in order of first appearance.
That is a spreadsheet column, not a name, and it fails three ways:

* **It says nothing.** "Group AB" tells you nothing about the sound, and a dense
  verse produces 257 of them.
* **It is unstable.** The letter depends on reading order, so the same rhyme is
  called something different in every song — and under every engine on the same
  song. Nothing can be compared or remembered.
* **It cannot be spoken.** People say "the *-ames* rhyme" or "the *lookin' boy*
  chain". Nobody says "group AB".

A group is now named after its own rime:

| Engine | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| similarity | `A` | `-im` — *women, him, slim* |
| similarity | `D` | `-ike` — *like, rhyme, while* |
| similarity | `Q` | `-eel` — *feel, wheel, appeal* |
| chains | `F` | `straight face lookin boy` |
| chains | `G` | `im devastatin` — *is ricochetin, its levitatin* |

Because the name comes from the phonetics it is **stable**: the same rhyme is
called the same thing everywhere. The colour is hashed from the name, so colour
becomes stable too — `-ames` is the same hue in every song.

### How a name is chosen

**Spelling is borrowed, not generated.** English orthography is too irregular to
synthesise from ARPAbet (`-ite` or `-yte`? `-oh` or `-ow`?), so the name is the
tail of a word that is actually in the verse. The exact rime is kept alongside
for anyone who wants it.

**The tail starts at the labelled syllable's vowel.** `rime_from_spelling`
counts vowel *runs*, so a digraph counts once, and indexes forward from the
start — which is why `shame` gives `-ame` rather than the silent `-e`, and
`asteroid` with its rime in syllable 2 gives `-oid` rather than `-asteroid`.

**The rime is the modal one.** A similarity-clustered group holds near-matches,
not identical sounds. Taking the first member's rime made the label and the
phonetics disagree — `-im` labelled a group printed as `IH T`. The commonest
`(nucleus, coda)` is what the group is heard as.

**Short tails win for the label; content words win for the examples.** The
shortest on-rime tail is the rime with least onset still clinging to it, so
`-or` from *for* beats `-ormal` from *normal*. Function words are demoted only
in the *examples*, where a reader needs something worth looking at.

**A label must contain a real vowel.** The letter-name in "J.J. Fad" once
labelled an entire group `-j`; `y` counts as a vowel only when it is not the
first letter, or a group of `AE` words comes out as `-yeah` instead of `-eah`.

**Collisions take another spelling before a number.** Two groups can honestly
land on `-at` while sounding different (`AH T` and `AE T`). The second takes its
next-best real spelling — `-atter` — and only falls back to `-at 2` if it has
none.

### Where it runs

`rename_groups(verse, chains=None)` runs after an engine has finished, from
`labeling.label_verse`, so every engine gets it and the naming has the completed
grouping to work from. Descriptions are left on `verse.metadata["groups"]` and
travel to the viewer with the rime, a few example words, and a **position map**
— where each occurrence falls across the verse. Two groups with the same count
can be spread evenly or bunched into one passage, and that difference is most of
what a rhyme scheme *is*.

---

## 6. Metrics (`src/metrics.py`) <a name="metrics"></a>

| Metric | Definition |
|---|---|
| `density` | % of syllables carrying any rhyme label |
| `multi` | % of syllables inside a run of ≥2 consecutive syllables sharing **the same** label |
| `diversity` | distinct groups / total syllables |
| `signatures` | number of distinct groups |
| `syllables` | total syllable count |

> Two different formulas were previously both exported as "Multi":
> `generate_stats.py` computed signature *diversity*, while `analyzer.py` counted
> adjacent labelled syllables **without checking the labels matched**. They fed
> the same CSV column and the same plots. The names are now distinct and the
> adjacency check is real.

---

## 7. Visualisation (`src/visual.py`) <a name="visual"></a>

`VisualEngine.display(verse, legend=False)` prints the verse with each labelled
syllable on a coloured background, and optionally lists the groups by size.
Escape codes are suppressed when `NO_COLOR` is set or stdout is not a TTY.

---

## 8. Batch analysis <a name="batch"></a>

`src/analyzer.py` owns the corpus pipeline; `scripts/generate_stats.py` is a thin
CLI over it. Previously each file carried its own copy of the loop with divergent
metric definitions.

```bash
python -m scripts.generate_stats --input CSV --output CSV [--min-occurrences N]
                                 [--tail-window N] [--only-terminal] [--max-rows N]
```

The default input is `dataset/artists_sample.csv`. The previous default pointed
at `dataset/lyrics_raw.csv`, which is not in the repository, so the target failed
with a traceback; a missing or malformed dataset now produces an actionable
message.

---

## 9. Analysis & plotting (`analysis/`) <a name="analysis"></a>

`run_all_plots.py` generates: `scatter_all`, `artist_averages`,
`boxplot_density`, `artist_similarity`, `artist_dendrogram`, and a per-track
similarity heatmap for each featured artist present in the data.

> This module previously did not run at all: it had two `__main__` blocks, imports
> in the middle of the file, and referenced an undefined `df`, so `make plots`
> raised `NameError`. The artist-similarity and dendrogram figures were
> unreachable. It also called `plt.show()` unconditionally, which blocks on a
> headless machine; the backend is now selected accordingly and figures are
> closed after saving.

---

## 10. Caching (`src/cache.py`) <a name="caching"></a>

Phoneme and syllable lookups are memoised in memory and in `.cache/*.json`.
Bump `CACHE_VERSION` when the stored format or lookup semantics change. Disk I/O
is best-effort: a read-only checkout degrades to the memory tier.

Measured on `dataset/artists_sample.csv`: **7.1s cold → 0.34s warm**.

---

## 11. Makefile <a name="makefile"></a>

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `make install` | dependencies + NLTK corpora |
| `make test` | unit tests |
| `make demo` | colour-code the demo verse |
| `make stats` | corpus → `data/stats.csv` |
| `make plots` | all figures |
| `make web` | export `web/data.js` and open the viewer |
| `make clean` | remove caches and generated files |

`make web` opens the viewer through Python's `webbrowser` module; it previously
shelled out to `firefox`.

---

## 12. Testing <a name="testing"></a>

`./run_tests.sh` runs `unittest discover` with the project root as the top-level
import directory, so no test needs to patch `sys.path`.

- `test_models.py` – dataclass behaviour
- `test_phonetics.py` – cleaning, backoff, syllabification
- `test_engine.py` – signatures, label space, candidate selection, labelling
- `test_metrics.py` – metric definitions

Tests needing the neural fallback skip themselves when the corpora are absent.

---

## 13. Dependencies <a name="dependencies"></a>

See `requirements.txt`. Note that `g2p_en` depends on `distance`, which does not
build against setuptools 60+; the README and CI workflow both document the
workaround.

---

**Version:** 2.0.0
