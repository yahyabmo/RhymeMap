"""Read a YouTube video's metadata and captions.

Audio is deliberately never downloaded. The viewer embeds YouTube's own player
and drives the highlight from its clock, which keeps playback on the platform
licensed to serve it, avoids shipping copyrighted audio, and costs no bandwidth.

Two things here exist because of how YouTube behaves rather than how it is
documented:

* **Client rotation.** YouTube serves different payloads to its Android app, its
  TV interface and its website, and blocks them independently. A request refused
  for one client often succeeds for another, so a failure is retried across
  clients before being reported. The list is intersected with the clients the
  installed yt-dlp actually knows, so a version change can never make this pass
  a name yt-dlp rejects.
* **oEmbed fallback.** When extraction is blocked outright, YouTube's public
  oEmbed endpoint still returns the title and the channel. That is enough to
  look the song up in a lyrics database, so a blocked extraction degrades to a
  lyrics-only result instead of failing.
